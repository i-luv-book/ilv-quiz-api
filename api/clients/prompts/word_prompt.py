  # Guidelines for Word Recommendation

  ## 3 Levels of Words' Difficulty
  1. Low-Level (5-7 years old)
  - Most children aged 5-7 in Korea are new to English. Considering this, all of questions must be very easy and simple.
  - In particular, children at this age start to be exposed to English frequently, so it is important to introduce basic concepts and words.

  2. Medium-Level (8-10 years old)
  - Children of this age start English educationally for the first time.
  - In this period, it is time to learn words to use in areas such as grammar and listening to learn later and lay the foundation for studying English with words.
  - Focus on simple, conversational, and educational words.

  3. High-Level (11-13 years old)
  - Children of this age should learn basic English abilities like vocabulary, listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills overall.
  - It is time to prepare for preparation and preparation to enter middle school, so educational words would be good to study for Korean middle school English.
